# Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) Detection 🚴🏼‍♀️💪
Hey there! Welcome to my DOMS Detection project. 
🚀 In this project, I'll give you a sneak peek into how I processed data, trained a machine learning model, and managed to deploy it into a microcontroller (Mikromedia 7 with STM32F746ZG chipset) using MikroC Pro for ARM. So, buckle up, and let's dive in!

**NOTES:** 
- In this project, I use Python Programming language for the software processing and use C Programming language for the Hardware Program. The data used in this project are primary data using 3 electromyography (EMG) from the Quadricep, Hamstring, and Calve muscles.
- Hardware used: a Microcontroller (Mikromedia 7 FPI Capacitive with STM32F746ZG MCU Card), 3 EMG Click, Electrodes

## 1. Software Processing 🔍
This section encompasses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Cleaning, and Modeling.
In this phase, my main goals are:
- Exploring the data
- Identifying necessary cleaning steps
- Built dataset
- Built machine learning model and evaluation

## 2. Hardware Program 🚀
This section encompasses Visualization, Integration, and Deployment.
In this phase, my main goals are:
- Design microcontroller interface
- Integration between 3 EMG sensors and microcontroller
- Deploy machine learning models that have been built in PC into microcontroller

### So, there you have it! My journey from collecting sensors data to deploying machine learning model into microcontroller. Feel free to check out the code! 🤓
